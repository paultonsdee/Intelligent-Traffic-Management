class ObjectSpeedCounter(BaseSolution):
    """
    A class to estimate the speed of objects in a real-time video stream based on their tracks.

    This class extends the BaseSolution class and provides functionality for estimating object speeds using
    tracking data in video streams.

    Attributes:
        spd (Dict[int, float]): Dictionary storing speed data for tracked objects.
        trkd_ids (List[int]): List of tracked object IDs that have already been speed-estimated.
        trk_pp (Dict[int, Tuple[float, float]]): Dictionary storing previous positions for tracked objects.
        count_zero (int): Counter for vehicles with zero velocity.
        count_positive (int): Counter for vehicles with positive velocity.
        annotator (Annotator): Annotator object for drawing on images.
        region (List[Tuple[int, int]]): List of points defining the speed estimation region.
        frame_threshold (int): Number of consecutive frames a vehicle must maintain its speed to be counted.
        zero_speed_frames (Dict[int, int]): Dictionary tracking consecutive zero-speed frames per vehicle.
        positive_speed_frames (Dict[int, int]): Dictionary tracking consecutive positive-speed frames per vehicle.
        counted_ids (Set[int]): Set of vehicle IDs that have been counted for zero speed.
        counted_positive_ids (Set[int]): Set of vehicle IDs that have been counted for positive speed.
        mode (str): Mode can be 'in' or 'out' to focus on objects inside or outside the region.

    Methods:
        initialize_region: Initializes the speed estimation region.
        estimate_speed: Estimates the speed of objects based on tracking data.
        store_tracking_history: Stores the tracking history for an object.
        extract_tracks: Extracts tracks from the current frame.
        display_output: Displays the output with annotations.
